Start by updating the site name and other options in the _config.yml file in the root of this repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make a post is to duplicate and edit an existing one (such as this one). Go into /_posts/ and update the "How to add items" markdown file. For more instructions see the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
