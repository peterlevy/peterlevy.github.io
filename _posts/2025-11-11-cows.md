title: Feasibility of offsetting methane emissions from cows by planting trees
---

## Question:

*What area of land would need to be planted with trees to make up for
the methane emissions from grazing cattle?*

This may seem a simple question, but equating the two sides of the
equation is complicated because it is hard to compare like with like.
Emissions from grazing (adult) cattle are constant over time, and depend
only on the number of cattle, not the area they occupy. Uptake by
planted woodland is proportional to the area and varies strongly over
time: initially zero or negative after planting, then positive until a
peak growth rate after ~30-50 years, then declining to zero as the
woodland matures. At some point a mature woodland reaches equilibrium
and becomes carbon neutral (where photosynthesis is balanced by total
ecosystem respiration).

So the question posed cannot be answered without specifying a time
period over which to consider the balance between emissions and uptake.
We can rephrase the question in a number of ways, depending on how we
choose to compare the two.

1.  What area of land would need to be planted with trees to offset the
    methane emissions from a single cow over the next 25 years (i.e. so
    as to meet the Net Zero 2050 target for that single cow)?
2.  What area of land would need to be planted with trees to offset the
    methane emissions from a single cow over the next 50 years?
3.  On a single farm with a fixed area, how long could grazing continue
    at a reasonable stocking density before the area of the land needed
    for woodland precludes grazing?

The timing of the woodland planting is also important, so we also need
to distinguish whether this happens at the start of a project or is
continuously on-going over time. There is a big benefit to the former.

We can consider each of these questions, given some parameters for
emissions from cows and uptake by trees.

### Methane from cows

One dairy cow emits about 100 kg of methane per year; for for non-dairy
cattle, the value is ~50-75 kg/yr - e.g. see
[here](https://teagasc.ie/environment/climate-change-air-quality/methane/)
or [here](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/emission-factors)). Here we
use a value of 75 kg of CH4 as an intermediate.

Methane has a global warming potential about 25 times that of CO₂ over a
100-year period, so that is equivalent to 1875 kg of CO₂ per year.

### Carbon uptake by trees

For a crude comparator, 1875 kg of CO₂ is equivalent to a mature Sitka
spruce tree (dbh of 35 cm, age ~50 years (Levy, Hale, and Nicoll 2004)).
So we need to add one mature tree, requiring 50 years to grow and
occupying about 16 m<sup>2</sup> (4 m spacing), for each cow, every
year.

To be properly quantitative so as to answer questions 1-3, we need to
consider the time course of tree growth in woodlands. Below, we show
data for sycamore/ash/birch from the [Woodland Carbon Code carbon
calculation
spreadsheet](https://www.woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/template-documents-and-tools-version-22).
(version 2.4.1, April 2024). We use this as typical of UK commercial
forestry in answering the questions below, but other species could be
chosen.

The annual change in carbon stock gives the annual flux of CO₂ into the
woodland shown below. The dashed line shows the instantaneous annual
flux in that year, while the solid line shows the mean flux over the
period since planting. Given the time period of interest, we can use the
latter to compare with the constant annual emissions from cows.

### Q1a. What area of land would need to be planted with trees *in 2025* to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the next 25 years (i.e. so as to meet the Net Zero 2050 target for that single cow)?

In this scenario, we consider the area of woodland planted in 2025
needed to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the
following 25-year period, up to 2050. The whole woodland grows to an age
of 25 years over this time. From Figure 1, the carbon sequestration in
woodland over this period is 41.95 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / m<sup>2</sup>, so
a mean uptake rate of 1.68 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / m<sup>2</sup> / year
(From Figure 2). The emissions from one cow is a constant 1875 kg
CO<sub>2</sub> / year. So, to offset the 25-year emissions from one cow,
you would need to plant 1117 m<sup>2</sup> of new woodland (1875 kg CO₂
divided by 1.67812 kg CO2/m<sup>2</sup>).

In some ways, the area the cattle occupy does not matter - you just need
to plant 1117 m<sup>2</sup> of new woodland per head of cattle. However,
if you want to express the required afforestation as a fraction of the
land area used for grazing, we need to specify the cattle stocking
density. A typical stocking density for conservation grazing is ~0.25
LU/ha = 1 cow per 4 hectares = 1 cow per 40,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The
required 1117 m<sup>2</sup> of woodland would constitute 2.7925 % of the
grazed area. A more typical stocking density for conventional grazing is
~1 LU/ha = 1 cow per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>. The required 1117
m<sup>2</sup> of woodland would constitute 11.17 % of the grazed area.

### Q1b. What area of land would need to be planted with trees *each year* to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the next 25 years (i.e. so as to meet the Net Zero 2050 target for that single cow)?

In this scenario, we consider the total area of woodland that would need
to be planted to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the
25-year period 2025-2050, if the woodland planting was on-going with an
equal area planted each year. Only 1/25th of the woodland grows to an
age of 25 years over this time, so the mean uptake rate is much lower -
the dotted line in Figure 2. The mean carbon sequestration across the
mixed age woodland over this period is 0.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub> /
m<sup>2</sup> / year. The emissions from one cow is still a constant
1875 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / year. So, to offset the 25-year emissions from
one cow, you would need to plant 4728 m<sup>2</sup> of new woodland
(1875 kg CO₂ divided by 0.396583499172781 kg CO2/m<sup>2</sup>).

At a typical stocking density for conservation grazing is ~0.25 LU/ha =
1 cow per 40,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 4728 m<sup>2</sup> of
woodland would constitute 11.82 % of the grazed area. At the more
typical stocking density for conventional grazing of 1 LU/ha = 1 cow per
10,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 4728 m<sup>2</sup> of woodland would
constitute 47.28 % of the grazed area.

### Q2a. What area of land would need to be planted with trees *in 2025* to offset the methane emissions from a single cow, over the next 50 years?

Here, we repeat the same calculations but consider a longer time period
where the woodland is allowed to grow to 50 years old. This makes a
sizeable difference because tree growth is slow initially, but much
faster from ~15-50 years.

In this scenario, we consider the area of woodland planted in 2025
needed to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the
following 50-year period, up to 2075. The whole woodland grows to an age
of 50 years over this time. From Figure 1, the carbon sequestration in
woodland over this period is 77.04 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / m<sup>2</sup>, so
a mean uptake rate of 1.54 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / m<sup>2</sup> / year
(From Figure 2). The emissions from one cow is a constant 1875 kg
CO<sub>2</sub> / year. So, to offset the 50-year emissions from one cow,
you would need to plant 1217 m<sup>2</sup> of new woodland (1875 kg CO₂
divided by 1.54072 kg CO2/m<sup>2</sup>).

To express the required afforestation as a fraction of the land area
used for grazing, we specify the same cattle stocking densities as
before. At a typical stocking density for conservation grazing of ~0.25
LU/ha = 1 cow per 40,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 1217 m<sup>2</sup>
of woodland would constitute 3.0425 % of the grazed area. At the more
typical stocking density for conventional grazing of ~1 LU/ha = 1 cow
per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 1217 m<sup>2</sup> of woodland
would constitute 12.17 % of the grazed area.

### Q2b. What area of land would need to be planted with trees *each year* to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the next 50 years

In this scenario, we consider the total area of woodland that would need
to be planted to offset the methane emissions from a single cow over the
50-year period 2025-2075, if the woodland planting was on-going with an
equal area planted each year. Only 1/50th of the woodland grows to an
age of 50 years over this time, so the mean uptake rate is much lower -
the dotted line in Figure 2. The mean carbon sequestration across the
mixed age woodland over this period is 0.6 kg CO<sub>2</sub> /
m<sup>2</sup> / year. The emissions from one cow is still a constant
1875 kg CO<sub>2</sub> / year. So, to offset the 50-year emissions from
one cow, you would need to plant 3145 m<sup>2</sup> of new woodland
(1875 kg CO₂ divided by 0.596204002174013 kg CO2/m<sup>2</sup>).

At a typical stocking density for conservation grazing is ~0.25 LU/ha =
1 cow per 40,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 3145 m<sup>2</sup> of
woodland would constitute 7.8625 % of the grazed area. At the more
typical stocking density for conventional grazing of 1 LU/ha = 1 cow per
10,000 m<sup>2</sup>, the required 3145 m<sup>2</sup> of woodland would
constitute 31.45 % of the grazed area.

### National-scale context

To put these numbers in a national-scale context, we need to consider
the UK population of cattle and the land area available.

To offset the UK cattle herd of ~6 million adults [Defra
2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/livestock-populations-in-the-united-kingdom/livestock-populations-in-the-united-kingdom-at-1-december--2),
half dairy and half beef, we can look at the national area of woodland
planting required, given the four scenarios. For comparison, the current
UK annual new planting rate is 206.6 km<sup>2</sup>/yr in 2023/4 [FR
2024](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/publications/forestry-statistics/forestry-statistics-2024/2024-1-woodland-area-and-planting/).
The target planting rate is 300 km<sup>2</sup>/yr.

1a. To offset the UK cattle emissions up to 2050 with up-front planting,
we would need to plant 6704 km<sup>2</sup> in 2025/6. This is 32 times
the current planting rate, and equivalent to 3 % of the total UK land
area.

1b. To offset the UK cattle emissions up to 2050 with on-going annual
planting, we would need to plant 1135 km<sup>2</sup> each year until
2050. This is 5 times the current planting rate, and would give a total
area equivalent to 12 % of the total UK land area.

2a. If we allow ourselves 50 years, we would need to plant 7302
km<sup>2</sup> up-front in 2025/6. This is 35 times the current planting
rate, and equivalent to 3 % of the total UK land area.

2b. With on-going annual planting over 50 years, we would need to plant
377 km<sup>2</sup> each year until 2075. This is 2 times the current
planting rate, and would give a total area equivalent to 8 % of the
total UK land area.

### Q3. On a single farm with a fixed area, how long could grazing continue at a reasonable stocking density before the area of the land needed for woodland precludes grazing?

Less arbitrarily, we could assume that both the grazing and
afforestation take place within the same fixed area. In this case, we
start with 40000 m<sup>2</sup> of grassland per cow, and convert 3145
m<sup>2</sup> to woodland each year. In this scenario, grassland is
gradually displaced by woodland over time, so the cattle stocking
density increases until the whole area is covered by woodland after 13
years.

<!-- 1. Estimate the rotation length on which any harvesting might occur, and use the
mean carbon stock over that period. You can then calculate the area of woodland
that has to be planted and maintained each year on that basis to offset the 
annual methane emissions from one cow. This is an equilibrium approach, as it is
based on a long-term average carbon stock.

2. Consider a fixed time interval over which grazing is to take place, and 
equate with the woodland carbon sequestration which can place over this same 
interval. This is a transient approach, as it considers the the immediate 
carbon sequestration as it progresses, rather than assuming anything about a 
long-term equilibrium.

3. Consider a fixed area of land which is used for both grazing and woodland. 
Here the question becomes how long can grazing be sustained before the area is
completely converted to woodland (or some livestock stocking density threshold 
exceeded). This is also a transient approach, but makes no assumption about 
additional land being available elsewhere to be afforested. -->
